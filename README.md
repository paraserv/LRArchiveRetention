# LogRhythm Archive Retention Manager

> **Versioning Note:** The authoritative version is defined in `ArchiveRetention.ps1` (`$SCRIPT_VERSION`).

## Disclaimer

**Use at your own risk.** This retention script is designed to delete specific files in high-volume according to the execution parameters you provide. You are solely responsible for ensuring you have good backups and thoroughly testing and validating this script, and your chosen parameters, in a non-production environment before any production use. Whether due to misconfiguration (such as setting an overly aggressive retention period) or if there are any bugs in the script, the risk of data loss or unintended deletions is entirely yours. The authors and contributors are not liable for any damages, data loss, or other consequences resulting from the use or misuse of this script.

---

This is a high-performance PowerShell script for managing the retention of files, particularly LogRhythm Inactive Archives. It automates the cleanup of old archive files while providing detailed logging and reporting. The latest version includes performance optimizations and enhanced logging capabilities.

This script is specifically designed for use with LogRhythm (LR7 SIEM) environments, targeting the files generated by the [Data Processor's InactiveArchivePath value](https://docs.logrhythm.com/lrsiem/docs/change-archive-location). LR7 Inactive Archives are the raw logs collected by LR System Monitor Agents and saved by the LogRhythm Mediator Server Service. The LR7 SIEM will never delete these files and so users must manage its retention using other methods, such as this script. Retaining these archive log files (.lca) allows you to utilize LogRhythm's SecondLook Wizard to reprocess and reindex the logs back into the SIEM, if needed. Inactive Archives do not affect the current searchability (indexing) of the SIEM. **Warning:** Do not configure this script to target LogRhythm's Active Archives (.lua). These are configured within the product with a value of 1 to 7 days and then automatically age into the Inactive Archive path.

## Features

- **Safe Execution**: Dry-run mode by default, requires `-Execute` flag for actual deletions
- **Minimum Retention Enforcement**: The script will never delete files newer than $MINIMUM_RETENTION_DAYS, which is hard-coded in the script for safety (default: 90 days, configurable by editing the script). If you specify a lower value with `-Execute`, the script will log a warning and enforce the minimum. Dry-run mode will warn but proceed with any value, showing what would be in scope for deletion with the given parameters.
- **Comprehensive Logging & Auditing**: All script activity is logged with timestamps, including file statistics, progress updates, error handling, and detailed output with `-Verbose`. In execute mode, every file deleted is also recorded in a dedicated audit log (`retention_actions/retention_*.log`) for compliance and traceability. Dry-run mode will show what would be deleted, but only actual deletions are audit-logged.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Customize retention periods (e.g., `-RetentionDays 1095`) and archive locations (`-ArchivePath`).
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient file scanning and processing, with real-time progress updates and robust error handling.

## Requirements

- Windows Server with LogRhythm Archive Manager
- PowerShell 5.1 or later
- Appropriate permissions on LogRhythm archive directories
- Sufficient disk space for log files

## Installation

1. Copy the `ArchiveRetention.ps1` script to your LogRhythm server
2. Place it in a directory with restricted permissions (e.g., `C:\LogRhythm\Scripts\LRArchiveRetention\`) so that only authorized administrators can modify or execute the script.
3. Ensure the script has read/write permissions to the archive directories

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```powershell
# Show help and available parameters
.\ArchiveRetention.ps1 -Help

# Dry run (shows what would be deleted)
.\ArchiveRetention.ps1 -ArchivePath "D:\LogRhythmArchives\InactiveTest" -RetentionDays 90 -Verbose

# Actual execution (deletes files)
.\ArchiveRetention.ps1 -ArchivePath "D:\LogRhythmArchives\InactiveTest" -RetentionDays 90 -Execute -Verbose

# Example output from dry run:
# Found 6,484 files (2.3 GB) that would be processed (older than 90 days)
# Oldest file: 20250303_1_1_1_638765599202720081.lca (Last modified: 03/02/2025)
# Newest file: 20250314_1_1_1_638775155530957788.lca (Last modified: 03/13/2025)
```

### Advanced Examples

```powershell
# Process a specific archive directory for 3 years
.\ArchiveRetention.ps1 -ArchivePath "D:\LogRhythmArchives\InactiveTest" -RetentionDays 1095 -Execute -Verbose

# Process with custom log location
.\ArchiveRetention.ps1 -ArchivePath "D:\LogRhythmArchives" -RetentionDays 365 -LogPath "C:\Logs\archive_retention.log" -Execute
```

### Scheduled Task Example

Create a scheduled task to run the script weekly:

```powershell
$action = New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute 'PowerShell.exe' -Argument '-NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\LogRhythm\Scripts\ArchiveV2\ArchiveRetention.ps1" -ArchivePath "D:\LogRhythmArchives" -RetentionDays 120 -Execute -Verbose'
$trigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -Weekly -DaysOfWeek Sunday -At 2am
$settings = New-ScheduledTaskSettingsSet -StartWhenAvailable -DontStopOnIdleEnd -RunOnlyIfNetworkAvailable
Register-ScheduledTask -Action $action -Trigger $trigger -Settings $settings -TaskName "LogRhythm Archive Retention" -Description "Runs LogRhythm archive retention weekly" -User "SYSTEM" -RunLevel Highest
```

> **Note**: Run the scheduled task as SYSTEM or a service account with appropriate permissions.

## Parameters

| Parameter         | Description                                               | Default/Required         |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| `-ArchivePath`    | Path to LogRhythm archive directory                      | Required                |
| `-RetentionDays`  | Number of days to retain archive files                   | Required                |

## Best Practices

1. **Always test first**: Run without `-Execute` to verify which files will be deleted
2. **Check disk space**: Ensure you have sufficient space before running with `-Execute`
3. **Start with a subset**: Test with a smaller directory first
4. **Review logs**: Check the log file after each run for any warnings or errors
5. **Schedule during off-peak**: Run during maintenance windows but not at the same time as other processes to minimize impact
6. **Monitor progress**: The script provides real-time progress updates
7. **Archive logs**: Regularly back up all script logs for compliance, auditing, and troubleshooting. This includes:
   - The current main script log (`script_logs/ArchiveRetention.log`)
   - Rotated/archived script logs (`script_logs/rotated_logs/ArchiveRetention_*.log`)
   - Retention action logs (`retention_actions/retention_*.log`)
8. **Backup first**: Ensure you have backups before running with `-Execute`
9. **Expect longer initial run times**: The first time you run the script (especially with `-Execute`), it may take significantly longer than subsequent runs, since it will likely have much more data to delete. Consider staging a few initial runs with larger retention days before getting to your target and setting up a scheduled task. Regular daily or weekly scheduled runs will typically be much faster.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Access Denied**
   - Ensure the script is run with administrative privileges
   - Verify the account has Full Control permissions on the archive directory

2. **Files Not Being Deleted**
   - Check if the files are older than the specified retention period
   - Verify the path is correct and accessible
   - Ensure no other processes have the files locked

3. **Performance Issues**
   - For large directories, consider increasing `-BatchSize`
   - Reduce `-MaxConcurrency` if system resources are constrained
   - Avoid running during peak hours

4. **Log File Growth**
   - Logs automatically rotate when they reach 10MB
   - Up to 5 log files are kept by default

5. **Minimum retention not honored:**
   - The script will never delete files newer than 90 days, regardless of the value you specify with `-Execute`.
   - Dry-run will show what would be deleted for any value, but will warn if below 90.

- **Access Denied**: Ensure the script runs with appropriate permissions
- **No files processed**: Verify the `-ArchivePath` is correct and contains `.lca` files
- **Unexpected deletions**: Always test without the `-Execute` flag and with `-Verbose` first to review actions
- **Log file issues**: Check disk space and permissions for the log directory
