# ArchiveRetention Performance Optimization Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the step-by-step plan to optimize the ArchiveRetention.ps1 script for better performance with large datasets while maintaining simplicity and reliability.

## Phase 1: Core Optimizations

### 1. Streamline File Processing
- [ ] Replace current file discovery with more efficient directory traversal
- [ ] Add progress reporting during file discovery
- [ ] Implement basic error handling for file operations

### 2. Add Parallel Processing
- [ ] Implement simple parallel processing with controlled concurrency
- [ ] Add progress tracking for parallel operations
- [ ] Include error handling for parallel tasks

### 3. Optimize Logging
- [ ] Implement batched logging to reduce I/O operations
- [ ] Add log rotation for the script's own logs
- [ ] Include performance metrics in logs

## Phase 2: Optional Enhancements

### 4. Add Simple Caching (Optional)
- [ ] Implement basic file-based caching
- [ ] Add cache validation
- [ ] Include cache invalidation logic

### 5. Resource Monitoring (Optional)
- [ ] Add basic system resource monitoring
- [ ] Implement dynamic throttling based on system load
- [ ] Add warning for high resource usage

## Implementation Notes
- Each step should be tested before moving to the next
- Performance benchmarks should be recorded before and after each major change
- Backups of the working script should be maintained at each phase

## Testing Strategy
1. Test with a small directory (100-1,000 files) for basic functionality
2. Test with a medium directory (10,000-100,000 files) for performance
3. Test with a large directory (1,000,000+ files) for scaling
4. Monitor memory and CPU usage during tests

## Rollback Plan
- Each optimization will be committed separately
- Git tags will be used to mark stable versions
- A simple rollback script will be provided to revert to the previous version
