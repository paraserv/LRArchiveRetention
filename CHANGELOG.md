  - Added path normalization for credential matching
  - Now correctly detects and handles network paths regardless of PowerShell's automatic escaping

## [2.3.11] - 2025-07-22

- Enhanced Complete-ScriptExecution to handle termination scenarios

## [2.3.3] - 2025-07-21

### Fixed

  - In streaming mode, the StreamWriter was kept open throughout the entire execution
  - Now closes StreamWriter after streaming deletion completes, before directory cleanup
  - Also closes StreamWriter before directory cleanup in non-streaming mode
  - This fully resolves the "file is being used by another process" error

## [2.3.2] - 2025-07-21

### Fixed
- **Critical fix**: Retention action log summary now properly written
  - StreamWriter was not being closed before Complete-ScriptExecution tried to append summary

- **Dry-run Mode**: Fixed hanging issue - now shows proper completion summary
- **Complete-ScriptExecution**: Fixed parameter handling to accept summary data

## [2.3.0] - 2025-07-20

### Added
- **Parallel Streaming Mode**: Revolutionary performance improvement for network operations
  - Combines streaming deletion with parallel processing for maximum throughput
  - Files are processed in batches as discovered, no pre-scan required
  - Automatic batch processing with configurable batch size (default: 500)
  - Expected performance: 120-160 files/sec on network shares with 8 threads
  - Enabled automatically when using `-Execute -ParallelProcessing`

### Changed
- Streaming mode now supports parallel processing for network share operations
- Progress reporting enhanced to show thread count in parallel streaming mode
- Batch processing logic unified between pre-scan and streaming modes

### Technical Details
- Uses same `Invoke-ParallelFileProcessing` function for consistency
- Maintains O(1) memory usage while maximizing deletion throughput
- Processes remaining batch after enumeration completes
- Fully backwards compatible - sequential streaming still available

## [2.2.6] - 2025-07-20

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL PERFORMANCE FIX**: Parallel processing now uses `[System.IO.File]::Delete()` instead of `Remove-Item`
  - Previous: Parallel mode was NOT faster than sequential due to using slow Remove-Item cmdlet
  - Now: Parallel mode should achieve 120-160 files/sec on network shares (4-8x improvement)
  - This completes the System.IO optimization for ALL code paths (streaming, sequential, and parallel)

## [2.2.5] - 2025-07-20

### Fixed
- **Critical bug fix**: Uninitialized `$processingStartTime` variable in streaming mode
  - In streaming mode, `$processingStartTime` was never initialized, causing null reference when calculating processing time
  - Now always initializes `$processingStartTime` before both streaming and batch processing modes
  - This was the root cause of "You cannot call a method on a null-valued expression" errors after streaming completion

## [2.2.4] - 2025-07-20

### Fixed
- **Critical bug fix**: Null reference error in streaming mode when calculating processing rates
  - In streaming mode, `$processedCount` was not properly tracked, causing null reference errors
  - Now uses `$successCount` for rate calculations in streaming mode
  - Fixed all occurrences where processed count is displayed or used in calculations
  - Affects lines 1792, 1800, 1812, and 1817 in the processing summary sections

## [2.2.3] - 2025-07-20

### Fixed
- **Critical bug fix**: Undefined variable $elapsedTimeStr causing null reference error
  - Error occurred in the processing summary section after streaming completion
  - Variable was being used but never defined in that scope
  - Now properly calculates and formats elapsed time before use

## [2.2.2] - 2025-07-20

### Fixed
- **Critical bug fix**: Null reference error after streaming mode completion
  - Script tried to process empty $allFiles array after streaming deletion
  - Now properly skips batch processing when streaming mode is used
  - Removes duplicate "Streaming deletion complete" log messages

## [2.2.1] - 2025-07-20

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL PERFORMANCE FIX**: Replaced PowerShell `Remove-Item` with `[System.IO.File]::Delete()` for file deletion
  - Previous: ~20 files/sec deletion rate
  - Expected: 100-500 files/sec deletion rate (5-25x improvement on local drives)
  - Network operations still limited by SMB latency (~15-20 files/sec single-threaded)
  - This fix implements the optimization specified in "Optimized Plan.md"
  - Affects both streaming mode and batch processing

### Added
- Performance tip when network path detected without parallel processing
- Recommendation to use `-ParallelProcessing -ThreadCount 8` for network shares
- Expected network performance: 120-160 files/sec with 8 threads

### Changed
- File deletion now uses direct .NET API for maximum performance
- Maintains same retry logic and error handling

## [2.2.0] - 2025-07-20

### Added
- **Streaming Deletion Mode**: Files are processed and deleted as discovered in EXECUTE mode
- **Zero Memory Growth**: Constant O(1) memory usage for any dataset size
- **Immediate Processing**: Deletions begin within seconds, no waiting for full scan

### Changed
- **Default Behavior**: EXECUTE mode now uses streaming deletion (no pre-scan)
- **Pre-scan Behavior**: Only performed in dry-run mode or when showing summaries
- **Progress Reporting**: Adapted for real-time streaming feedback
- **Memory Model**: Eliminated array building for execute operations

### Performance
- **Memory Usage**: From O(n) to O(1) - handles millions of files with minimal RAM
- **Start Time**: Deletions begin immediately vs waiting for full scan completion
- **Interruption Safe**: Progress is saved continuously, no lost work
- **Scalability**: No practical limit on number of files processed

### Technical Details
- Pre-scan still available for dry-run mode to show what would be deleted
- Batch processing logic preserved but bypassed in streaming mode
- Statistics (oldest/newest files) still tracked without array building

## [2.1.0] - 2025-07-20

### Added

- **Real-time Performance Metrics**: Display scan rate (files/second) during enumeration

### Changed
- **File Enumeration Method**: Replaced `Get-ChildItem` with streaming `System.IO` enumeration
- **Memory Usage**: Reduced from O(n) to O(1) memory complexity during file scanning
- **Scan Progress**: Enhanced progress reporting with performance metrics

### Performance
- **Expected Improvements**: 10-20x faster file enumeration on large datasets
