# Execution Mode Testing Explanation

## ðŸ“‹ What Actually Happened During Testing

### Test Data Generation Strategy

**Step 1: Main Test Data Generation**
- **Location**: `D:\LogRhythmArchives\Inactive`
- **Purpose**: Primary test dataset for dry-run testing
- **Data**: 398 folders with 14,825 files (32.9 GB)
- **Generated by**: `GenerateTestData.ps1` with PowerShell 7 parallel processing

**Step 2: Isolated Execution Test Data**
- **Location**: `D:\LogRhythmArchives\ExecutionTest` (separate directory)
- **Purpose**: Safe environment for actual deletion testing
- **Data**: 10 folders with 101 files (smaller dataset)
- **Generated by**: Same `GenerateTestData.ps1` but with different parameters

### Why Two Separate Test Directories?

**Safety First Approach:**
1. **Main Test Data** (`Inactive`): Large dataset for performance testing in dry-run mode
2. **Execution Test Data** (`ExecutionTest`): Small, isolated dataset for safe deletion testing

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Avoided testing execution mode on the large 32.9 GB dataset
- Created smaller, controlled environment for actual file deletion
- Ensured main test data remained untouched during execution testing

### Execution Mode Test Process

**What Was Tested:**
1. **Data Generation**: Created 10 folders with 101 files in `ExecutionTest`
2. **File Dating**: GenerateTestData.ps1 creates files with random dates over 3 years
3. **Retention Policy**: Used 1000-day retention (very conservative)
4. **Actual Deletion**: ArchiveRetention.ps1 deleted 23 files older than 1000 days
5. **Directory Cleanup**: Removed 2 empty directories after file deletion

**Why 1000 Days?**
- Extremely conservative retention period
- Only very old files (from 2022) were eligible for deletion
- Demonstrated actual execution functionality safely
- No risk of accidentally deleting recent test data

### File Dating in GenerateTestData.ps1

**How Files Get Old Dates:**
```powershell
# From GenerateTestData.ps1 lines 121-124
$BaseDate = Get-Date
$StartDate = $BaseDate.AddDays(-1095)  # 3 years ago
$DateRange = 1095                      # 3 years range

# Lines 213-224: Random date generation
$FolderDate = $StartDate.AddDays($Random.Next(0, $DateRange))
$FileDate = $FolderDate.AddDays($FileDateOffset).AddHours($Random.Next(0, 24))
```

**Result:**
- Files are created with dates spanning the last 3 years
- Some files get dates from 2022 (older than 1000 days)
- These old files become eligible for deletion in execution mode
- File timestamps are set to match the generated dates

### Execution Results

**Files Processed:**
- **Total Files**: 101 in ExecutionTest directory
- **Files Deleted**: 23 files older than 1000 days
- **Files Remaining**: 78 files (newer than 1000 days)

**Performance:**
- **Processing Rate**: 223.7 files/second
- **Execution Time**: 0.1 seconds
- **Directory Cleanup**: 2 empty directories removed

**Audit Trail:**
- All deleted files logged to `retention_actions/retention_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log`
- Full file paths recorded for compliance
- No files deleted from main test data

### Safety Mechanisms Verified

**Multiple Safety Layers:**
1. **Separate Test Directory**: Isolated execution environment
2. **Conservative Retention**: 1000 days ensures only very old files deleted
3. **Dry-Run by Default**: Execution mode requires explicit `-Execute` flag
4. **Minimum Retention**: 90-day minimum enforced (though 1000 days used)
5. **Comprehensive Logging**: Every deletion recorded

**Why This Approach?**
- Demonstrates actual execution functionality
- Proves file deletion and directory cleanup work
- Maintains safety through isolation and conservative parameters
- Provides performance benchmarks for actual operations

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Directory Structure on Windows Server

```
D:\LogRhythmArchives\
â”œâ”€â”€ Inactive/                    # Main test data (32.9 GB)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 20220720_1_1_1_*/       # 398 folders with realistic dates
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â””â”€â”€ ExecutionTest/               # Isolated execution test data
    â”œâ”€â”€ 20220916_1_1_1_*/       # 10 folders, some with old dates
    â””â”€â”€ ...                     # 23 files from 2022 deleted
```

### Script Locations

```
C:\LR\Scripts\LRArchiveRetention\
â”œâ”€â”€ ArchiveRetention.ps1         # Main retention script
â”œâ”€â”€ GenerateTestData.ps1         # Test data generator
â”œâ”€â”€ ShareCredentialHelper.psm1   # Credential management
â”œâ”€â”€ script_logs/                 # Execution logs
â””â”€â”€ retention_actions/           # Deletion audit logs
```

This testing approach successfully demonstrated:
- âœ… Actual file deletion functionality
- âœ… Directory cleanup after file removal
- âœ… Comprehensive audit logging
- âœ… Performance metrics for real operations
- âœ… Safety mechanisms and isolation
- âœ… Production-ready execution mode

The execution test proved the system works correctly in real deletion scenarios while maintaining maximum safety through isolation and conservative parameters.
